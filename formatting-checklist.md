Graduate College Thesis Requirements
====================================

Required thesis sections
------------------------

The following sections are required and must be included in all master’s
theses and doctoral dissertations:

- [ ]  [Abstract](#abstract) (page ii)
- [x]  [Table of contents](#TOC)
- [x]  [Main text](#main_text) (separated into chapters)
- [ ]  [Bibliography or references](#bibliography)

Note the absence of List of Tables and List of Figures sections.
These sections are generally not necessary, and the
Thesis Office advises students who are interested in a quick review with
few or no corrections requested to leave these sections out of the
thesis or dissertation. Also note that the Table of Contents is most
useful for the reader when entries are limited to chapter-level titles
only or to chapter-level titles and first-level (main) section headings,
as has been done in the examples above.

Title page requirements
-----------------------

 - [] See [Step 2](/step-2-departmental-approval) for information about
the process for filing your title page with the Graduate College Thesis
Office prior to submitting your thesis for review.

Refer to the master’s or doctoral title page example provided in
the [sample thesis
pages](/sites/default/files/PDFs/SampleThesisPages.pdf) as you read
through the following sections on the format requirements for the title
page.

### **Page Set-up**

- [x]  Set margins to one inch on all sides of the page.
- [ ]  Set line spacing for the entire page to single space.
- [x]  Do not display a page number anywhere on the page.
- [ ]  Center all text except the adviser or committee information
    horizontally between the left and right margins.
- [x]  Do not use boldface type on the title page.
- [x]  Use italics only for scientific or
    specialized terminology.

### Title (2 inches from the top edge of the page)

- [x]  Set the title in all capital letters.

### BY and Name (3.5 inches from the top edge of the page)

The student name that appears on the title page should match the
student name recorded on the [Thesis/Dissertation Approval (TDA)
form](/forms/certificate).

- [x]  Set BY in all capital letters.
- [x]  Set your name in all capital letters.
- [x]  One blank line must separate BY and your name.

### The Label "THESIS" or "DISSERTATION" (5.5 inches from the top edge of the page)

- [x]  Title pages for doctoral dissertations should display the
    label DISSERTATION.
- [x]  Set THESIS or DISSERTATION in all capital letters.

### Text Block with Degree, Major, and Year of Conferral

- [x]  One blank line should separate the label THESIS or
    DISSERTATION and the text block.
- [x]  The text block will be either 4, 5, or 6 lines long and must
    be divided into the following lines exactly as shown:

1.  Submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements
2.  for the degree of <add earned degree> in <add
    major>
3.  with a concentration in <add concentration>
4.  with a minor in <add minor>
5.  in the Graduate College of the
6.  University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, <add year of
    degree conferral>

- [x]  Line 2 of the text block must contain: (a) the degree for
    which the thesis is being submitted and (b) the student’s major (not
    the name of the student’s department).
- [x]  The major must fit entirely onto line 2 of the text block. (It
    may be necessary to reduce the font size of the entire text block in
    order to allow for the major to fit entirely onto the
    second line.)
- [x]  Most students will not include lines 3 or 4. There are very
    few campus-approved graduate concentrations and graduate minors.
    (The list of campus-approved graduate minors can be found
    [here](http://provost.illinois.edu/ProgramsOfStudy/2013/fall/programs/index.html).)
    If a concentration or minor cannot be verified by the University’s
    records, it will not be allowed on the title page.
- [x]  The year in line 6 of the text block must be the year of the
    degree conferral period for which the student will deposit (e.g., if
    a student deposits in December 2015 for the May 2016 graduation
    period, the year in the text block should be 2016).

### Location (7.5 inches from the top edge of the page)

- [x]  The location is Urbana, Illinois (do not
    abbreviate Illinois).

### Adviser or Committee Information (8 inches from the top edge of the page)

- [x]  Doctoral students will use the heading “Doctoral
    Committee:”
- [x]  The heading “Adviser:” or “Doctoral Committee:” or equivalent
    must begin at the left margin.
- [x]  One blank line should separate the heading “Adviser:” or
    “Doctoral Committee:” or equivalent and the names of the committee
    members or adviser.
- [x]  List each committee member on a separate line.
- [x]  Adviser and committee member names should be indented
    approximately half an inch from the left margin.
- [x]  For committees, the committee chair should be listed first,
    and the director of research (adviser) should be listed second; all
    other committee members may be listed in the order preferred by the
    student or the student’s adviser.
- [x]  The committee chair should be indicated by adding a comma and
    the word “Chair” after the chair’s name.
- [x]  The director of research (if different from chair) should be
    indicated by adding a comma and the phrase “Director of Research”
    after the director’s name.
- [x]  “Co-Chair” and “Co-Director of Research” designations may be
    used when applicable.
- [x]  Faculty members should be listed with their professorial title
    (i.e., Professor, Associate Professor, Assistant
    Professor, etc.).
- [x]  The professorial title should be spelled in full (do
    not abbreviate) and listed before the faculty member’s name.
- [x]  Affiliations should be listed only for committee members who
    are not University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign faculty (i.e.,
    departmental affiliations should not be listed).
 

Abstract requirements
----------------------------------

- [x]  An abstract is required for all theses
    and dissertations.
- [ ]  The abstract must be placed immediately after the
    title page.
- [x]  The page number Roman numeral two (ii) must appear on the
    first page of the abstract.
- [x]  The abstract must be written in English.
- [x]  There is no word limit for the abstract.

 

Table of contents requirements
------------------------------

Refer to the Table of Contents examples provided in the [sample thesis
pages](/sites/default/files/PDFs/SampleThesisPages.pdf) as you read
through the following section.

- [x]  A Table of Contents is required for all theses and dissertations.
- [ ]  All chapter titles and titles of chapter equivalents (e.g., List of
    Symbols, Bibliography, Appendix A, etc.) must be listed in the Table
    of Contents.
- [ ]  Do not include the Abstract or any other sections that are placed
    before the Table of Contents in the list of entries in the Table
    of Contents.
- [ ]  Headings from within chapters are not required to be listed in the
    Table of Contents by the Graduate College. (The Thesis Office
    strongly encourages students to keep the Table of Contents as simple
    as possible. The purpose of the Table of Contents is to be a quick,
    useful reference for the reader, not to outline the argument of the
    thesis in detail.)
- [ ]  Titles (and any headings, if included) listed in the Table of
    Contents must exactly match the wording found in the text (except
    that abbreviations or references that appear in the text as
    parenthetical additions may be omitted from the Table of Contents).
- [ ]  If headings are numbered, heading numbers listed in the Table of
    Contents must exactly match the heading numbers found in the text.
- [ ]  Page numbers listed for headings must be correct.
- [ ]  List only the page number of the first page of the chapter
    or section. (Do not list a range of page numbers.)
- [ ]  Page numbers must be aligned at or near the right margin of
    the page.
- [ ]  Leader dots must be displayed between the final word of each title
    and the page number.

 

Minimum requirements for main text
----------------------------------

### Margins

- [x]  For every page in the thesis, margins must be a minimum of (but may
    be greater than) 1 inch on all sides.
- [ ]  Theses with any material (other than page numbers) extending into
    the 1-inch margin on one or more sides will not be accepted
    for deposit.

 - [ ] __PO NOTE: Top header (chapter heading+page number) is outside the margin..__. Keeping this in there for committee, but it can be changed in tufte-common.def, under fancy page style. Just remove everything except \thepage
 - [ ] __PO NOTE: Doublecheck margin notes, sometimes they flow beyond the bottom margin__

### Fonts

- [x]  Font size for body text may be from 10- to 12-point and ...
- [ ] ... should remain consistent throughout the front matter and main text and must
    be easily legible.
- [x]  Font size and type may differ for footnotes, figure captions, table
    data, references, and material in an appendix and may be as small
    as 7-point. _PO: minimum in my style file is 8-point, /small is 9-point)_
- [x]  Script and ornamental fonts will not be accepted. _(PO: Never!)_

### Line Spacing

- [x]  Spacing of the body text may be from 1.5 lines to Double and must
    remain consistent throughout the main text.
    - _PO Note: It's unclear what "1.5 lines" translates to, so I used the setspace package with /onehalfspacing _
- [x]  Single-spacing within the main text is allowed for titles, headings,
    footnotes, endnotes, references, lengthy quotations, bulleted or
    numbered lists, figure or table captions, or material in
    an appendix.

### Pagination

- [ ]  All pages (other than title page and optional copyright page) must
    display page numbers.
- [ ]  Pages prior to the main text should be numbered with Roman numerals
    (beginning with the abstract as page ii).
- [x]  Pages in the rest of the thesis should be numbered with Arabic
    numerals (beginning with 1 and continuing through the end of
    the document).
- [ ]  Page numbers must be placed at least half an inch from the edge of
    the page.
- [x]  Each chapter or chapter equivalent must begin on a new page.

 

Bibliography or references
--------------------------

There is no reference style required by the Graduate College Thesis
Office. However, departments may require the use of a reference style
that is appropriate to the student’s program of study.

- [x]  All theses are required to have either a bibliography or a list
    of references.
- [x]  When placed at or near the end of a thesis, the references section
    is considered a chapter equivalent; therefore, the title of the
    section should be formatted like a chapter title.
- [x]  In some scientific and engineering disciplines, the references may
    be placed at the end of each chapter instead of at the end of
    the thesis.

 

Format requirements for figures, tables and other illustrative material
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Refer to the figure and table examples provided in the
[sample thesis
pages](/sites/default/files/PDFs/SampleThesisPages.pdf) as you read
through the following section.

A thesis may include tables, figures, photographs,
musical examples, charts, graphs, line drawings, maps, and other
illustrative materials. For discussion purposes, these media will be
called figures.

- [x]  All figures must fit within the minimum
    1-inch margins. Theses with any material extending beyond these
    margins will not be accepted for deposit.
- [x]  Figures must be numbered consecutively throughout
    the entire thesis. Students may choose from one of two options:


1.  A straight sequence (1, 2, 3, etc.). (Using this
    method, continue figure numbering from the previous chapter. Do not
    re-start the numbering at 1.)
2.  The decimal system (1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 2.1, 2.2,
    etc.), in which the first digit corresponds to the chapter number
    and the digit after the decimal point is the figure number within
    the chapter. (Do not number figures by section (e.g., 1.2.1, 1.3.2,
    or the like. Using this method, figures in Appendix A, B, C, and so
    forth would be numbered A.1, A.2, B.1, B.2, C.1 and
    so on.)

- [x]  Tables should be numbered independently from figures.
- [x]  Figure captions may be single-spaced and are not
    required to be set in the same font style or size as that of the
    main text.
- [x]  Figure captions should appear on the same page as
    the figure to which they refer.

### Figure Placement

The Graduate College Thesis Office strongly encourages
students to group figures at the end of chapters or at the end of the
main text to avoid many of the problems associated with placing figures
next to their corresponding text.

- [x]  Figures should not be placed out of the order in
    which they are numbered.
- [x]  If figures are grouped at the end of a chapter or
    the main text, each figure may be placed on a
    separate page.
- [x]  Multiple figures may be placed on the same page as
    long as doing so does not compromise
    their legibility.
- [x]  Figures grouped at the end of a chapter are
    considered a section, the first page of which should display the
    appropriate section heading (i.e., “Figures”, “Tables”, “Figures and
    Tables”, etc.).
- [x]  Figures grouped at the end of the main text are
    considered a chapter, the first page of which should display the
    appropriate chapter title (i.e., “Figures”, “Tables”, “Figures and
    Tables”, etc.).
- [x]  Do not add figure callouts (i.e., <place Figure
    2.1 about here>) anywhere in the thesis.

### Multiple-Page Figures

- [x]  Every page containing part of a multiple-page
    figure must include at least an abbreviated figure label such as
    “Figure 2.5 (cont.)”.
- [x]  The figure caption is only required to appear
    once; an abbreviated label may be used on
    subsequent pages.

### Rotated Figures

- [x]  Figures that are rotated should be rotated
    counterclockwise so that the top of the figure faces toward the
    left (inside) edge of the page.
- [x]  Page numbers, headings, captions, and titles may
    be rotated with the figure.

### Color Figures

Use of color in the thesis is acceptable. However,
because theses may be converted to black-and-white if they are archived
on microfilm or partially reproduced on a black-and-white printer,
labels, symbols and other data within figures should be identified
through other means than the use of color.

 

Citation of previously published material
-----------------------------------------

Inclusion of work that has been previously published by the degree
candidate is a common practice in research institutions across the
country, and it is permitted at the University of Illinois. In such
cases, the Graduate College requires that the student state at the
beginning of the chapter that the work includes previously published
material.

This is accomplished by including

 - [x]  a footnote at the bottom of the first page of the chapter in which the
 previously published material appears that acknowledges the previous publication,
   - **PO Note** Margin note
 - [x]  cites basic bibliographic information, and
 - [x]  states that the copyright owner has provided permission
to reprint.

In scientific disciplines, it is also common for students to
include material derived from a published paper with multiple authors.
In such cases,

- [x]  the footnote must acknowledge the contribution of the
other authors, including any figures, tables, or data that were not
created by the author

Students with further questions regarding copyright and the use of
previously published material should refer to [copyright information and
resources](/step-1-development#copyright).

 

Notes regarding other sections
------------------------------

### (Optional) Copyright Page

Inclusion of a copyright page is optional.

- [ ]  If included, the copyright page is an unnumbered page at the
    beginning of the thesis, and the copyright notice should be centered
    horizontally and vertically on the page in the following format:

Copyright (year of degree conferral) (name of student as it appears on
title page)

Example: Copyright 2015 Jane Doe

### (Optional) List of Tables, List of Figures

The Graduate College Thesis Office discourages the inclusion of a List
of Tables or List of Figures.

- [ ]  If included, the List is considered a chapter equivalent. It should
    be placed after the Table of Contents and should be listed in the
    Table of Contents.
- [ ]  If included, the List should be formatted exactly like the Table of
    Contents, except that captions may be shortened in the List (refer
    to [Table of Contents Requirements](#TOC)).

### (Optional) Appendix(es)

The appendix is a section that is placed near the end of the thesis and
may contain material such as tables, figures, maps, photographs, raw
data, computer programs, musical examples, interview questions, sample
questionnaires, CDs, and many other types of material.

- [ ]  An appendix is considered a chapter equivalent and the appendix
    title should be formatted like a chapter title.
- [ ]  Multiple appendices should be numbered A, B, C, and so on. Each
    appendix should be treated as a separate chapter equivalent and will
    therefore start on a new page.
- [ ]  Page numbers used in the appendix must continue from the main text.

As part of the thesis, any appendix materials must be reviewed and
approved by the director of research and committee.

The thesis or dissertation itself should be understandable without the
supplemental appendix materials.

As part of the ETD submission, students may upload supplemental
electronic files as part of their thesis or dissertation. These files
are considered appendix items, and an appendix page must be included as
part of the thesis and should be numbered accordingly. This page should
include an appendix title, such as “Appendix A: Interview
Transcriptions,” and a brief description of the material along with the
name of the file in which the material is contained. See the [sample
thesis pages](/sites/default/files/PDFs/SampleThesisPages.pdf) for an
appendix page example.

### (Not Accepted) Curriculum Vitae or Author’s Biography

Do not include a curriculum vitae or author's biography in your thesis;
the Graduate College no longer accepts these sections.

Instead, the Thesis Office encourages students looking for
recommendations on how to document and share their professional
accomplishments in ways that can be updated as new opportunities arise
to contact the [Graduate College Career Development
Office](/careerdevelopment).

 

A note on departmental requirements
-----------------------------------

This list describes only Graduate College requirements for student
theses. The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign confers graduate
degrees in over 100 units, and many of these departments have
additional, discipline-specific format requirements. Students should
consult with their program regarding departmental format requirements
and departmental thesis review procedures.

*Note: The Graduate College Thesis Office will not begin the thesis
format review without notification of departmental approval.*
