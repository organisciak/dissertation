# HTTPS Setup instructions

1. Set up elastic load balancer to forward HTTPS to port 8080

Trickiest part here is creating a private key, then a certificate request, then getting it signed (or signing my own). Instructions
for this were here: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/ElasticLoadBalancing/latest/DeveloperGuide/elb-create-https-ssl-load-balancer.html#configure-https-listener

If Health check isn't passing for the underlying EC2 machine, visit that machine's public DNS on port 8080 (make 8080 public in web security) and see if it works

2. Get the DNS name for the ELB
It should open to the same place as the public ec2 server

3. (if necessary): Switch your domain service to use Amazon S3 as its DNS (I did this to my Google Domains registered domain)
http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/MigratingDNS.html

4. Create a Hosted Zone, then add a Record set that aliases to the load balancer
http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/resource-record-sets-creating.html

5. Try the domain: does it work?

## NOTE: THE EC2 SERVER IS STILL PUBLIC (AND ACCESSIBLE THROUGH 8080â€¦)
if this matters, it should be on a private subnet in the VC, only visible to
the load balancer
