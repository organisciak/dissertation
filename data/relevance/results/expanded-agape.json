Seeing you as a beautiful woman, both of us with roles to play in bringing life and hope to this world brings me closer to agape love, closer to respect, and it is here where lust and greed are driven out. Your burden is not to conform to a beauty standard, and it\u2019s not to bear the responsibility of my sexuality or the behavior or misbehavior of men.",

                    "description": "the magician  ; his power is transformation through the use of his will. In his manipulation of the basic elements into all the substances and materials of life, he shows us that from a foundation of the mundane can emerge all that is to come. He can take the Nothing from which the Fool emerged and shape it into Something, making one out of zero. Clearly this is power of a divine sort, and it is true that the Magician is a conduit for a higher power, which commands all of the material world. Since all that we can see in the physical world is the conduit himself, the acts he performs often seem like magic. The Magician may seem like a strange title for someone who holds real power, because the word \"magician\" tends to conjure up pictures of illusionists and escape artists, whose power involves sleight of hand and misdirection. The Magician, however, is similar to the stage illusionist in many ways. He is confident in his skills and his ability to produce the effects that he wants. His real power comes from sources outside of him, and he is powerless without these sources, just as an illusionist depends on people \"behind the scenes\". Both magician and Magician, however, are as important to their powers are the powers are to them. Without a conduit, power itself is impotent and useless. With his powers the Magician holds influence over all -theory and practice, logic and emotion, thought and action. Almost every modern depiction of the Magician includes one or more symbols of infinity to denote his limitless power; the snake eating its tail and the lemniscate (horizontal figure-eight) being chief among these. This limitless power comes from sources outside his body yet under his control. And as long as the Magician remembers that this power is his to command, even if he loses all of his worldly power and skill he can never truly be called powerless. For his Will is a power that, while it can be subdued, it can never be destroyed. Another nearly universal association with the Magician is the red-and-white color scheme. This theme recurs throughout the Tarot and it is very symbolic that it starts with this card and not the Fool. For while the Fool was the potential for positive and negative, the Magician is the union of positive and negative. He creates and he preserves; he destroys and he redeems. His true power is that he not only knows what he must do, but he knows how he must do it, and why he must do it. Then he does it. The Magician reminds us that a wish alone will change nothing, but a decision can change everything. A desire to create is nothing without an ability to create, and vice-versa. When the Magician appears he shows that you are ready to become a conduit for power, like he is. The forces of creation and destruction have always been at your command but now you have the wisdom and confidence needed to use them constructively. Now is the time to act, if you know what is it you want to accomplish and why. Since the powers of transformation are at your command, change your desires into objectives, your thoughts into actions, your goals into achievements. If you have recently met with failure, now you can change that failure into success as easily as the Magician changes fire into water. The only limits you have are those you impose on yourself. The outward manifestations of such power are as numerous as they are varied, but the most common outer effect of the Magician's influence is unswaying and total confidence. The realization that the world is under your control is what inspires this kind of confidence, and with good reason. So go out into the world, set your mind to whatever goal you are interested in, and then just stand back and watch as everything falls into place under your command. Ultimately, the message of the Magician is a simple one despite his limitless and infinitely complex power. Your life is under your control. Your life is what you want it to be. Your life is what you make it.",

You never write to me at all, you do not love your husband; you know the pleasure that your letters give him yet you cannot even manage to write him half a dozen lines, dashed off in a moment! What then do you do all day, Madame? What business is so vital that it robs you of the time to write to your faithful lover? What attachment can be stifling and pushing aside the love, the tender and constant love which you promised him? Who can this wonderful new lover be who takes up your every moment, rules your days and prevents you from devoting your attention to your husband?Beware, Josephine; one fine night the doors will be broken down and there I shall be. In truth, I am worried, my love, to have no news from you; write me a four page letter instantly made up from those delightful words which fill my heart with emotion and joy. I hope to hold you in my arms before long, when I shall lavish upon you a million kisses, burning as the equatorial sun.\"",

                    "description": "From the celebrated twenty-nine-year-old author of the everywhere-heralded short-story collection St. Lucy\u2019s Home for Girls Raised by Wolves (\u201cHow I wish these were my own words, instead of the breakneck demon writer Karen Russell\u2019s . . . Run for your life. This girl is on fire\u201d\u2014Los Angeles Times Book Review) comes a blazingly original debut novel that takes us back to the swamps of the Florida Everglades, and introduces us to Ava Bigtree, an unforgettable young heroine.  The Bigtree alligator-wrestling dynasty is in decline, and Swamplandia!, their island home and gator-wrestling theme park, formerly #1 in the region, is swiftly being encroached upon by a fearsome and sophisticated competitor called the World of Darkness. Ava\u2019s mother, the park\u2019s indomitable headliner, has just died; her sister, Ossie, has fallen in love with a spooky character known as the Dredgeman, who may or may not be an actual ghost; and her brilliant big brother, Kiwi, who dreams of becoming a scholar, has just defected to the World of Darkness in a last-ditch effort to keep their family business from going under. Ava\u2019s father, affectionately known as Chief Bigtree, is AWOL; and that leaves Ava, a resourceful but terrified thirteen, to manage ninety-eight gators and the vast, inscrutable landscape of her own grief.  Against a backdrop of hauntingly fecund plant life animated by ancient lizards and lawless hungers, Karen Russell has written an utterly singular novel about a family\u2019s struggle to stay afloat in a world that is inexorably sinking. An arrestingly beautiful and inventive work from a vibrant new voice in fiction.",

Take a child's size sleeping bag, poke holes for where the straps need to be inserted through, sew around the edges of the holes you just made, and then put the straps through. It has been a life saver for me without needed to worry if the blanket falls or not covering enough. My baby still uses a beanie, jacket, and gloves, but this is so much easier then piling blankets on him early in the morning.",

Thai Kitchen brand curry paste (the green curry option), 1-2 cans of coconut milk (feeding 1 to 3 people-1 can, any more-2 cans). at least 2 to 3 tbsp of the paste per 1 can of coconut milk or to taste. Vegetable wise: sweet potato, carrots, green bell pepper, red bell pepper, onion (at least 1), broccoli, cauliflower   cooking:  whisk the desired amount of curry paste with the coconut milk on med-hi heat until boiling in a large skillet/wok.  Next, add in the veggies (just cube all the vegetables and cut the potato relatively small), get it all to a boil, and then set on simmer.  The simmer time is up to you. That night I think I let it cook for about 5 hours. It really brings out the flavor and gets all of the oils going!",

The streets are clean, people keep their yards really nicely. It's fairly pet friendly, though barking dogs are not welcomed. The crime rate is practically non-existent, unless you count the odd human sacrifice, dismemberment, animal attack, demon rape and blood atonement. When Paula Wittmore goes home to Haven Woods to care for a suddenly ailing mother, she brings her daughter and a pile of emotional baggage. She also brings the last chance for twelve of her mother's closest frenemies, who like to keep their numbers at thirteen. And her daughter, young, innocent, is a worthy gift to the darkness.    A circle of friends will support you through bad times. A circle of witches can drag you through hell.",

However, the trick is to wear leopard, zebra, cheetah, snake, tiger, or whatever without going overboard.  The basic rule: If a print is subtle, an older woman can wear more of it, but if a print is flashy, she should wear it in small accents.  This is not always true, but if you start out with this rule, you can adapt it to fit your body type and your personality.",

At first I didn\u2019t believe it, but then she started to caress my chest and stroke my arms. I was awestruck, but let her do anyways, you know right?

It was great, except for the slobber; that was a little much\u2026 it was my chance to find out from where she\u2019d come from. So I asked her and brace yourselves - she barked!\u201d",

I didn't bother with reserving a cup of it. I just used my immersion blender and left a little bit of it chunky. I swapped out the heavy cream with low fat milk. You could also use Greek yogurt. Instead of just marjoram, I used an Italian herb blend that contained it. Also used more garlic than called for, as always.",
