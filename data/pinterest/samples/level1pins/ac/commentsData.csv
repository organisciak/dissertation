"Sensual Kiss
softly,
softly,
fingertips,
brushing errant strands
from o’er hypnotic eyes
rose petal skin quivers
beneath feathered touch
cupping gently,
palms to jaw,
thumbs caressing blushing cheeks
heartbeat quickening,
sensual energy
passed electrically through glistening pores
inhale deeply of scented hair,
intoxicating aroma
in silky, floral essence
weighted eyelids sink lower,
soft moans
escape from within
thought lost in
delicious amnesia,
will controlled by the body’s desires
slowly,
as tender,
passions ignite
fires released in a.. sensual kiss....","Sat, 15 Feb 2014 16:10:23 +0000",412572153272095101

"AP Physics, 2006. 1.5 hours to take the exam. 300 questions of straight up full out physics problems that take about 10 minutes each (regardless if you reach the right answer). When time finished, most students left the rest blank, hoping the teacher would only grade what was attempted. Few of us guess at the rest of the problems we didnt finish. I guessed C for every remaining problem. The exams were curved 33%. What grade did I get? 90%, second best grade. :D When in doubt, choose C.","Wed, 07 May 2014 14:55:50 +0000",338544234397183482
