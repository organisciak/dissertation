"Bottom layer was Size 2 Diapers, I think around 30 or so...  Middle layer was Size 1, about 20 or so... and top layer was about 8 or so Newborn size diapers.  They were some diapers I had leftover, so I made these for a gift.

It is sitting on a piece of cardboard, I cut out from one of the diaper boxes and taped some wrapping paper on it.  

To make the diaper cake, I took a soup can and put it in the middle of a pie pan.. I then wrapped the diapers around kinda fanning it out as I went around the soup can.. Then I tied it together with some twine.  I lifted the diapers out of the pan and put it on the cardboard.  I then did a second and third layers the same way etc.  I took the soup can out and either filled inside with rolled up diapers or maybe put a bottle of lotion or something in the middle.

I used 3 baby washcloths and rolled them up, kinda looks like a rose sticking out of the cake.  I took some ribbon and cut and hot glued in spots to hold on the twine.  I then topped the cake with a rattle type of animal..  

Any questions email me.. Ill have to take pics and do a step by step one next time.","Sun, 29 Sep 2013 04:14:45 +0000",275704945846521439
