"Alternate recipe: 2 eggs, 2 cups buttermilk, 2 cups all-purpose flour, 1 tsp. vanilla, 2 teaspoons baking powder, 1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt, 1/2 teaspoon baking soda, 2 tablespoons sugar, 1/4 cup melted unsalted butter, 1 T melted or softened butter (for pan).  Separate the eggs and beat whites until stiff but not dry, and set aside. In another bowl, combine egg yolks, buttermilk, vanilla, flour, baking powder, salt, baking soda, sugar, and butter. Beat until smooth, and then fold in the egg whites. Heat an aebleskiver pan over medium heat and brush each depression with melted butter. Pour about 2 tablespoons of the batter into each cup, and, when bubbly around the edges, turn quickly with a long wooden skewer or toothpick, trying not to puncture the balls. Continue cooking, turning the ball to keep it from burning. You can also add half the batter to the pan, add a teaspoon of jam or fruit, then cover with remaining batter.

"Johnnathan Kim - these particular ones were homemade stencils. You can get rolls of stencil vinyl at craft stores like Michaels. Just google the image of whatever gun it's for, print, and cut the silhouette out of your vinyl. Tape to ammo can and spray paint. Ditto if you want a non-standard font, or else you can buy text stencils all over the place. Hope that helps!","Fri, 22 Nov 2013 14:25:03 +0000",15551698621694785
