"The Obelisk of Axum, was itself collapsed and broken when it was found by Italian soldiers at the end of 1935, following the Italian conquest of Ethiopia. It had fallen in the 4th century and had broken into five pieces. In 1937, it was taken as war booty and moved to Italy by the Fascist regime, which wanted to commemorate the conquest of Ethiopia and the birth of the ephemeral ""new Roman Empire.""","Thu, 29 May 2014 04:01:51 +0000",547257929628135618

It was then transported to Rome, where it was reassembled and erected on Porta Capena square in front of the Ministry for Italian Africa (later the headquarters of the United Nations's Food and Agriculture Organization) and the Circus Maximus. It was officially unveiled on October 28 1937 to commemorate the 15th anniversary of the March on Rome.

"""Fear and the Witch Doctors"" - A tale of fear and how our leaders use it to manipulate the masses. This story visits three primitive witch doctors to learn how they used fear to control their clans. Nothing has changed, today our leaders use the same trickery.

""Alexia Tarabotti, Lady Maccon, has settled into domestic bliss. Of course, being Alexia, such bliss involves integrating werewolves into London High society, living in a vampire's second best closet, and coping with a precocious toddler who is prone to turning supernatural willy-nilly. Even Ivy Tunstell's acting troupe's latest play, disastrous to say the least, cannot put a damper on Alexia's enjoyment of her new London lifestyle.""   The last book in the series, I've so enjoyed that I had to pace myself to make them last but alas, they are gone too soon... It's the mark of a great series when the characters become friends that you miss hearing from.

"Siglo XIX. En una remota aldea de Dinamarca, dominada por el puritanismo, dos ancianas hermanas, que han permanecido solteras, recuerdan con nostalgia su lejana juventud y la rígida educación que las obligó a renunciar a la felicidad. La aparición de Babette, que llega desde París, huyendo del Terror, cambiará sus vidas. La recién llegada tendrá pronto ocasión de corresponder a la bondad y al calor con que fue acogida. Un premio de lotería le permite organizar una opulenta cena con los mejores platos y vinos de la gastronomía francesa. Todos los vecinos aceptan la invitación, pero se ponen previamente de acuerdo para no dar muestras de una satisfacción que sería pecaminosa. Pero, poco a poco, en un ceremonial intenso y emotivo, van cediendo a los placeres de la cocina francesa. (FILMAFFINITY).","Thu, 20 Sep 2012 15:05:03 +0000",258112759802104646

"This is an amazing blend of mohair and wool worsted medium-weight yarn. A friend of mine introduced me to this discounted website where they sell skeins that have some flaws (mill ends where the end of one fiber is tied to another in the middle of the skein, or bulky parts where the spinning didn't occur properly), but since the regular price for Lamb's Pride is $7-$9 per skein, and this website sells for about $4 each, it's an incredible deal! I made one afghan for my niece, and am working on more for Christmas. The colors are rich and beautiful.","Mon, 29 Oct 2012 19:55:10 +0000",471822635869672110

"Nature is the genetic makeup encoded in your DNA where information for every type of characteristic is passed on. For example, if both creators have green eyes, then their offspring will most likely have green eyes as well because it is the dominant trait. Nurture is the environment factors the individual is exposed to. For example, is the child is encourage to read daily, then the child will grow up loving to read.","Fri, 30 May 2014 04:21:16 +0000",379991424717842238
"This picture shows the link between heredity and the environment. The mother and father have the trait to roll their tongues therefore because of genetics, the son is able to do it as well. The role that the environment plays in this picture is that even though some are able to roll their tongue, it doesn't mean that others will enjoy seeing it. People's decisions affects how the inherit traits are used.","Fri, 30 May 2014 04:21:33 +0000",379991424717842238
"This concept of nature and nurture is important to me because it affects everyone's future. The way people express themselves based on their heredity and environment is who they become as individuals. It also interest me because my parents are loud and stubborn, but I am quiet and reasonable. This may be because of the environment I grew up and my peers. Also, everyone in my family can roll their tongue but I can not. Now why is that?","Fri, 30 May 2014 04:21:43 +0000",379991424717842238

They are actually rubber caps that slide over the claws. It's a lot more humane than declawing your cat.,"Wed, 06 Feb 2013 16:32:48 +0000",9288880389886388
LOL even in my comment I couldn't write!  Migraine meds and no caffeine... I shouldn't have been near a keyboard. ^^;,"Wed, 06 Feb 2013 17:36:20 +0000",32017984759270367
"Oh... little rubber caps...  wonder how they stay on?  I hope they aren't a choking hazard.  My kitty would would be gnawing on them, and digging them into the scratchy trying to get them off.  But that sounds like a really innovative way to go instead of declawing.","Wed, 06 Feb 2013 17:47:17 +0000",32017984759270367
"I think they keep them on with a drop of glue.  The caps don't hinder the growth of the claws underneath, so they have to be replaced when the claws grow out.","Wed, 06 Feb 2013 18:50:16 +0000",9288880389886388

"i like this idea: 7. Have a Surprise Bag of Treats

Go to the $2 store and buy a bunch of toys, wrap them and every couple of hours allow your child to unwrap one and play with it on the plane. This is such a great way to turn a boring plane flight into a treasure trove of fun.","Mon, 22 Sep 2014 02:51:29 +0000",441352969640753687
