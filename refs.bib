This paper is concerned with developing probabilistic models and computational algorithms for social annotations. We propose a unified framework to combine the modeling of social annotations with the language modeling-based methods for information retrieval. The proposed approach consists of two steps: (1) discovering topics in the contents and annotations of documents while categorizing the users by domains; and (2) enhancing document and query language models by incorporating user domain interests as well as topical background models. In particular, we propose a new general generative model for social annotations, which is then simplified to a computationally tractable hierarchical Bayesian network. Then we apply smoothing techniques in a risk minimization framework to incorporate the topical information to language models. Experiments are carried out on a real-world annotation data set sampled from del.icio.us. Our results demonstrate significant improvements over the traditional approaches.},

These tags represent quite a few different aspects of the resources they describe and it is not obvious whether and how these tags or subsets of them can be used for search. This paper is the first to present an in-depth study of tagging behavior for very different kinds of resources and systems - Web pages (Del.icio.us), music (Last.fm), and images (Flickr) - and compares the results with anchor text characteristics. We analyze and classify sample tags from these systems, to get an insight into what kinds of tags are used for different resources, and provide statistics on tag distributions in all three tagging environments. Since even relevant tags may not add new information to the search procedure, we also check overlap of tags with content, with metadata assigned by experts and from other sources. We discuss the potential of different kinds of tags for improving search, comparing them with user queries posted to search engines as well as through a user survey. The results are promising and provide more insight into both the use of different kinds of tags for improving search and possible extensions of tagging systems to support the creation of potentially search-relevant tags.},

	abstract = {Social bookmarking is a recent phenomenon which has the potential to give us a great deal of data about pages on the web. One major question is whether that data can be used to augment systems like web search. To answer this question, over the past year we have gathered what we believe to be the largest dataset from a social bookmarking site yet analyzed by academic researchers. Our dataset represents about forty million bookmarks from the social bookmarking site del.icio.us. We contribute a characterization of posts to del.icio. us: how many bookmarks exist (about 115 million), how fast is it growing, and how active are the {URLs} being posted about (quite active). We also contribute a characterization of tags used by bookmarkers. We found that certain tags tend to gravitate towards certain domains, and vice versa. We also found that tags occur in over 50 percent of the pages that they annotate, and in only 20 percent of cases do they not occur in the page text, backlink page text, or forward link page text of the pages they annotate. We conclude that social bookmarking can provide search data not currently provided by other sources, though it may currently lack the size and distribution of tags necessary to make a significant impact},

Nowadays, many services, e.g. del.icio.us, have been developed for web users to organize and share their favorite webpages on line by using social annotations. We observe that the social annotations can benefit web search in two aspects: 1) the annotations are usually good summaries of corresponding webpages; 2) the count of annotations indicates the popularity of webpages. Two novel algorithms are proposed to incorporate the above information into page ranking: 1) {SocialSimRank} ({SSR})calculates the similarity between social annotations and webqueries; 2) {SocialPageRank} ({SPR}) captures the popularity of webpages. Preliminary experimental results show that {SSR} can find the latent semantic association between queries and annotations, while {SPR} successfully measures the quality (popularity) of a webpage from the web users' perspective. We further evaluate the proposed methods empirically with 50 manually constructed queries and 3000 auto-generated queries on a dataset crawledfrom delicious. Experiments show that both {SSR} and {SPRbenefit} web search significantly.},

However, because the experimenter gives up the direct control over the participants' environments and behavior, concerns about the quality of the data collected in online settings are pervasive. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of conducting online performance evaluations of user interfaces with anonymous, unsupervised, paid participants recruited via {MTurk}. We implemented three performance experiments to re-evaluate three previously well-studied user interface designs. We conducted each experiment both in lab and online with participants recruited via {MTurk}. The analysis of our results did not yield any evidence of significant or substantial differences in the data collected in the two settings: All statistically significant differences detected in lab were also present on {MTurk} and the effect sizes were similar. In addition, there were no significant differences between the two settings in the raw task completion times, error rates, consistency, or the rates of utilization of the novel interaction mechanisms introduced in the experiments. These results suggest that {MTurk} may be a productive setting for conducting performance evaluations of user interfaces providing a complementary approach to existing methodologies.},

Recently two methods based on random sampling were proposed as a solution to the extensive effort required to judge tens of thousands of documents. While the first method proposed by Aslam et al. [1] is quite accurate and efficient, it is overly complex, making it difficult to be used by the community, and while the second method proposed by Yilmaz et al., {infAP} [14], is relatively simple, it is less efficient than the former since it employs uniform random sampling from the set of complete judgments. Further, none of these methods provide confidence intervals on the estimated values. The contribution of this paper is threefold: (1) we derive confidence intervals for {infAP}, (2) we extend {infAP} to incorporate nonrandom relevance judgments by employing stratified random sampling, hence combining the efficiency of stratification with the simplicity of random sampling, (3) we describe how this approach can be utilized to estimate {nDCG} from incomplete judgments. We validate the proposed methods using {TREC} data and demonstrate that these new methods can be used to incorporate nonrandom samples, as were available in {TREC} Terabyte track '06.},

Recently, it has also been applied to information retrieval. According to this new paradigm, each document is viewed as a language sample, and a query as a generation process. The retrieved documents are ranked based on the probabilities of producing a query from the corresponding language models of these documents. In this paper, we will present a new language model for information retrieval, which is based on a range of data smoothing techniques, including the Good-Turning estimate, curve-fitting functions, and model combinations. Our model is conceptually simple and intuitive, and can be easily extended to incorporate probabilities of phrases such as word pairs and word triples. The experiments with the Wall Street Journal and {TREC}4 data sets showed that the performance of our model is comparable to that of {INQUERY} and better than that of another language model for information retrieval. In particular, word pairs are shown to be useful in improving the retrieval performance.},

In this paper, we advocate the use of realtime micro-blogging data for addressing both of these problems. We propose a method to use the micro-blogging data stream to detect fresh {URLs}. We also use micro-blogging data to compute novel and effective features for ranking fresh {URLs}.

	abstract = {The language modeling approach to retrieval has been shown to perform well empirically. One advantage of this new approach is its statistical foundations. However, feedback, as one important component in a retrieval system, has only been dealt with heuristically in this new retrieval approach: the original query is usually literally expanded by adding additional terms to it. Such expansion-based feedback creates an inconsistent interpretation of the original and the expanded query. In this paper, we present a more principled approach to feedback in the language modeling approach. Specifically, we treat feedback as updating the query language model based on the extra evidence carried by the feedback documents. Such a model-based feedback strategy easily fits into an extension of the language modeling approach. We propose and evaluate two different approaches to updating a query language model based on feedback documents, one based on a generative probabilistic model of feedback documents and one based on minimization of the {KL}-divergence over feedback documents. Experiment results show that both approaches are effective and outperform the Rocchio feedback approach.},

	abstract = {Presents a series of studies showing that the sources of innovation vary greatly; possible sources include innovation users, suppliers of innovation-related components, and product manufacturers. These types of roles are known as functional areas. Specific areas of innovation are marked by having innovators predominantly in one specific functional area. Using empirical data from industrial histories, the authors show that this innovation-function relationship has held in scientific instrument, semiconductor and printed circuit board assembly process innovations. Users are predominantly the innovators in these fields. Also identifies a few industries where manufacturers are typically the innovators and a few others where suppliers tend to be.        Analysis of the economic rents of innovation expected by potential innovators can often, if not always, by itself predict the functional source of innovation. Innovating firms will do so only when these rents prove attractive. Two factors suggest that this will tend to limit exploitation of the innovation to a functional area. First, it is difficult for innovators to adopt new functional relationships to their innovations. Second, innovators face a poor ability to capture innovation rents by licensing their innovation-related knowledge to others. This hypothesis and its implications are tested against the empirical datasets used initially. The role of informal R\&D know-how trading is also discussed and analyzed using the Prisoner's Dilemma. Guidance is given to innovation managers and policymakers.  ({CAR})},

Intrinsic motivation remains an important construct, reflecting the natural human propensity to learn and assimilate. However, extrinsic motivation is argued to vary considerably in its relative autonomy and thus can either reflect external control or true self-regulation. The relations of both classes of motives to basic human needs for autonomy, competence and relatedness are discussed.},

	abstract = {Over the past few years the crowdsourcing paradigm has evolved from its humble beginnings as isolated purpose-built initiatives, such as Wikipedia and Elance and Mechanical Turk to a growth industry employing over 2 million knowledge workers, contributing over half a billion dollars to the digital economy. Web 2.0 provides the technological foundations upon which the crowdsourcing paradigm evolves and operates, enabling networked experts to work collaboratively to complete a specific task. Enterprise crowdsourcing poses interesting challenges for both academic and industrial research along the social, legal, and technological dimensions. In this paper we describe the challenges that researchers and practitioners face when thinking about various aspects of enterprise crowdsourcing. First, to establish technological foundations, what are the interaction models and protocols between the Enterprise and the crowd. Secondly, how is crowdsourcing going to face the challenges in quality assurance, enabling Enterprises to optimally leverage the scalable workforce. Thirdly, what are the novel (Web) applications enabled by Enterprise crowdsourcing.},

However, this market appears to be inherently infested with a significant share of malicious workers who try to maximise their profits through cheating or sloppiness. This serves to undermine the very merits crowdsourcing has come to represent. Based on previous experience as well as psychological insights, we propose the use of a game in order to attract and retain a larger share of reliable workers to frequently-requested crowdsourcing tasks such as relevance assessments and clustering. In a large-scale comparative study conducted using recent {TREC} data, we investigate the performance of traditional {HIT} designs and a game-based alternative that is able to achieve high quality at significantly lower pay rates, facing fewer malicious submissions.},

The main reason behind this trend is that makes possible to conduct experiments extremely fast, with good results and at low cost. However, like in any experiment, there are several details that would make an experiment work or fail. To gather useful results, user interface guidelines, inter-agreement metrics, and justification analysis are important aspects of a successful crowdsourcing experiment. In this work we explore the design and execution of relevance judgments using Amazon Mechanical Turk as crowdsourcing platform, introducing a methodology for crowdsourcing relevance assessments and the results of a series of experiments using {TREC} 8 with a fixed budget. Our findings indicate that workers are as good as {TREC} experts, even providing detailed feedback for certain query-document pairs. We also explore the importance of document design and presentation when performing relevance assessment tasks. Finally, we show our methodology at work with several examples that are interesting in their own.},

	abstract = {As the customs of the Internet grow increasingly collaborative, crowdsourcing offers an appealing frame for looking at the interaction of users with online systems and each other. However, it is a broad term that fails to emphasize the use of crowds in subtler system augmentation.

This paper introduces incidental crowdsourcing ({IC}): an approach to user-provided item description that adopts crowdsourcing as a frame for thinking about augmentative features of system design. {IC} is intended to frame discussion around peripheral and non-critical system design choices.

A provisional definition of incidental crowdsourcing will be defined in this paper, and then refined based on examples seen in practice. {IC} will be examined from both the user and system ends, positioned within existing work, and considered in the context of its benefits and drawbacks. This approach allows us to explore the robustness and feasibility of {IC}, looking at the implications inherent to accepting the provisional definition.

The consequences of considering system design on a scale between {IC} and non-{IC} design choices remain to be seen. Toward this goal, the second part of this paper shows a study comparing the participation habits of users in two online systems — one that is representative of {IC} properties and one that is not. This study finds differences in user engagement between the two systems.},

In the context of information retrieval, where human-encoded relevance judgments underlie the evaluation of new systems and methods, the ability to quickly and reliably collect trustworthy annotations allows for quicker development and iteration of research.In the context of paid online workers, this study evaluates indicators of non-expert performance along three lines: temporality, experience, and agreement. It is found that user performance is a key indicator for future performance. Additionally, the time spent by raters familiarizing themselves with a new set of tasks is important for rater quality, as is long-term familiarity with a topic being rated.These findings may inform large-scale digital collections' use of non-expert raters for performing more purposive and affordable online annotation activities.},

We investigate several variations to deal with discrete and continuous response variables as well as with different objective functions. The main advantages of this technique over standard memory-based methods are higher accuracy, constant time prediction, and an explicit and compact model representation. The latter can also be used to mine for user communitites. The experimental evaluation shows that substantial improvements in accucracy over existing methods and published results can be obtained.},

The article examines the conceptualization and development of Transcribe Bentham, and how editorial practices at the Bentham Project may change as a result. We account for the design of the bespoke transcription tool which is at the project's heart, and which allows volunteers to transcribe the material and encode it in {TEI}-compliant {XML}. We attempt to answer five key questions: is crowdsourcing the transcription of complex manuscripts cost-effective? Is crowdsourcing exploitative? Are volunteer-produced transcripts of sufficient quality for editorial use and uploading to a digital repository, and what quality controls are required? Does crowdsourcing ensure sustainability and widen access to this priceless material? And finally, should the success of a project like Transcribe Bentham be measured solely according to cost-effectiveness or the volume of work produced, or do considerations of public engagement and access outweigh such concerns?},

	abstract = {Modern information retrieval ({IR}) has come to terms with numerous new media in efforts to help people find information in increasingly diverse settings. Among these new media are so-called microblogs. A microblog is a stream of text that is written by an author over time. It comprises many very brief updates that are presented to the microblog's readers in reverse-chronological order. Today, the service called Twitter is the most popular microblogging platform. Although microblogging is increasingly popular, methods for organizing and providing access to microblog data are still new. This review offers an introduction to the problems that face researchers and developers of {IR} systems in microblog settings. After an overview of microblogs and the behavior surrounding them, the review describes established problems in microblog retrieval, such as entity search and sentiment analysis, and modeling abstractions, such as authority and quality. The review also treats user-created metadata that often appear in microblogs. Because the problem of microblog search is so new, the review concludes with a discussion of particularly pressing research issues yet to be studied in the field.},

The basic idea of these approaches is to estimate a language model for each document, and then rank documents by the likelihood of the query according to the estimated language model. A core problem in language model estimation is smoothing, which adjusts the maximum likelihood estimator so as to correct the inaccuracy due to data sparseness. In this paper, we study the problem of language model smoothing and its influence on retrieval performance.  We examine the sensitivity of retrieval performance to the smoothing parameters and compare several popular smoothing methods on different test collections.},

Here we investigate the effect of compensation on performance in the context of two experiments, conducted on Amazon's Mechanical Turk ({AMT}). We find that increased financial incentives increase the quantity, but not the quality, of work performed by participants, where the difference appears to be due to an "anchoring" effect: workers who were paid more also perceived the value of their work to be greater, and thus were no more motivated than workers paid less. In contrast with compensation levels, we find the details of the compensation scheme do matter--specifically, a "quota" system results in better work for less pay than an equivalent "piece rate" system. Although counterintuitive, these findings are consistent with previous laboratory studies, and may have real-world analogs as well.},

Recently, we have seen numerous sophisticated schemes of identifying such workers. Those, however, often require additional resources or introduce artificial limitations to the task. In this work, we take a different approach by investigating means of a priori making crowdsourced tasks more resistant against cheaters.},

How can one trust the labels obtained from such services? We propose a model of the labeling process which includes label uncertainty, as well a multi-dimensional measure of the annotators' ability. From the model we derive an online algorithm that estimates the most likely value of the labels and the annotator abilities. It finds and prioritizes experts when requesting labels, and actively excludes unreliable annotators. Based on labels already obtained, it dynamically chooses which images will be labeled next, and how many labels to request in order to achieve a desired level of confidence. Our algorithm is general and can handle binary, multi-valued, and continuous annotations (e.g. bounding boxes). Experiments on a dataset containing more than 50,000 labels show that our algorithm reduces the number of labels required, and thus the total cost of labeling, by a large factor while keeping error rates low on a variety of datasets.},

This has come to be called crowdsourcing. The approach taken in examining the crowdsourcing paradigm is of retrospection, with a study focused on observed examples and existing theories. Thirteen cases of existing crowdsourcing sites were selected for study, from a larger sample of 300. These cases were coded by their site properties and analyzed, identifying possible motivational mechanisms. Subsequent interviews with eight medium to heavy Internet users further explored these features, with an emphasis on ranking relative importance of various motivators. This study concludes with a series of recommendations on motivating crowds in such projects, emphasizing among others the importance of topical interest, ease of participation, and appeals to the individuals’ knowledge. In addition to base motivators, a number of support, or secondary, motivators are outlined.},

	abstract = {Human linguistic annotation is crucial for many natural language processing tasks but can be expensive and time-consuming. We explore the use of Amazon's Mechanical Turk system, a significantly cheaper and faster method for collecting annotations from a broad base of paid non-expert contributors over the Web. We investigate five tasks: affect recognition, word similarity, recognizing textual entailment, event temporal ordering, and word sense disambiguation. For all five, we show high agreement between Mechanical Turk non-expert annotations and existing gold standard labels provided by expert labelers. For the task of affect recognition, we also show that using non-expert labels for training machine learning algorithms can be as effective as using gold standard annotations from experts. We propose a technique for bias correction that significantly improves annotation quality on two tasks. We conclude that many large labeling tasks can be effectively designed and carried out in this method at a fraction of the usual expense.},

When people play the game they help determine the contents of images by providing meaningful labels for them. If the game is played as much as popular online games, we estimate that most images on the Web can be labeled in a few months. Having proper labels associated with each image on the Web would allow for more accurate image search, improve the accessibility of sites (by providing descriptions of images to visually impaired individuals), and help users block inappropriate images. Our system makes a significant contribution because of its valuable output and because of the way it addresses the image-labeling problem. Rather than using computer vision techniques, which don't work well enough, we encourage people to do the work by taking advantage of their desire to be entertained.},

But a complete project requires the execution of "mundane but necessary" tasks as well. In this paper, we explore how the mundane but necessary task of field support is organized in the case of Apache web server software, and why some project participants are motivated to provide this service gratis to others. We find that the Apache field support system functions effectively. We also find that, when we partition the help system into its component tasks, 98\% of the effort expended by information providers in fact returns direct learning benefits to those providers. This finding considerably reduces the puzzle of why information providers are willing to perform this task "for free." Implications are discussed.},
