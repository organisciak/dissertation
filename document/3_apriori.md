##### Incidental Crowdsourcing

In <!--TODO: cite incidental crowdsourcing paper -->, I looked at a facet of crowdsourcing that I called _incidental crowdsourcing_ (IC).

Incidental crowdsourcing refers to crowdsourcing in the periphery.
These are elements that are unobtrusive and non-critical to the user or the system.
They generally
 describe existing information,
 collect contributions in low-granularity mechanisms,
 and favor interface choices over statements.
An example an incidental crowdsourcing mechanic mike be a 'thumbs-up' voting button on a video-sharing website or tagging functionality on an image-sharing website that does not force itself upon users.

By not taking users hostage or asking users for overly attentive or time-consuming contributions, incidental crowdsourcing contributions result in greater numbers of contributions, even if individual contributions are less frequent.
They also tend toward different patterns of contribution.

This was clear in a small example study <!--CITE IC DH --> comparing a crowdsourcing element on two systems: one that was designed more 'incidental' while another put up more hurdles for contributing quality.
In the systems, I compared the ratings of identical product on two application marketplaces for the Android smartphone operating system: Amazon's Appstore and Google Play.
Users on both systems are able to rate applications on a five-point scale;
however, while Google's store allows them to offer this rating quickly and without any other guidelines, Amazon's store requires an accompanying review with a minimum word length, and also has a codebook that reviewers must abide by.

The difference between rating 

While there are other potential factors affecting differences between the systems, this cursory comparison suggests that the attentiveness and introspection required of a crowdsourcing contribution affects what that contribution will look like.

##### System 1 vs System 2

More evidence for this was encountered in a peripheral finding while conducting \cite{}<!-- TODO cite human computation? Of just  -->.
In this case, we were again looking at opinion ratings on a five-point scale, this time on Mechanical Turk. 
Workers were asked to provide their personal opinions on whether they liked the style of each of 100 saltshakers.
In one group of workers, this is all they were asked.
In another group, we also asked workers to explain why they gave that rating.
In most other regards the ratings were collected in the same way:
 on Mechanical Turk during the US work day,
 in an interface designed identically -- besides the additional text input boxes for the latter formulation --
 and with the same restrictions on workers.
<!-- To clarify the restrictions? -->
<!--The payment for the task was scaled to account for the extra time necessary for completion: in the first set of tasks, workers averaged XXX/hr, on the latter, they averaged XXX/hr ... TODO: what _did_ we do for the money? -->

Figure XXX <!-- TODO --> shows the distribution of workers by their average rating.
In the first set, where workers rated quickly (<--(TODO: time)-->), the workers' average ratings were across the board.
There were very positive workers, very negative workers, and everything in between.
While the average worker gave a rating of <!--TODO-->, the standard deviation was <!--TODO-->.

It is clear that workers in the more set with more introspection

## Scope

### Paid Crowdsourcing
In looking at the design of contribution tasks, I hope to concentrate on paid crowdsourcing.
For the scope of this study, it would be intractable to look at at the design of both paid and volunteer crowdsourcing, so I will pursue the facet more pertinent to information retrieval.
<!--'More pertinent': Is this true? TODO: Rewrite-->
Paying workers is only one part of crowdsourcing, and one that arguably tethers the scalability of a task by anchoring it
to financial means.
However, it is easier to control for by removing much of the complexities of motivation.
Information retrieval researchers are also using the predictability of paid crowd markets like Amazon's Mechanical Turk to generate on-demand data, making design for those systems important.
<!--Add citations?-->

More importantly, much information retrieval research occurs parallel to the system of content
