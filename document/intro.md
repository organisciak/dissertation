# Notes

# Introduction

# Problem
Set up the problem and propose hypothesis, speaking on a higher level.

## Notes

 * Much crowdsourcing research makes an adversarial assumption

 * Crowdsourcing aggregates contributions from human participants/workers. While such contributions are helpful for understanding the content in an information system, they are

## A Priori

## Posterior Corrections of Bias

# Hypothesis
 * Move in to the practical part of the problem that I'll be addressing.

# Relevance to IS and IR

## Notes

Discuss relevance of problem to information science and specifically information retrieval.

This is partially strategic for myself: I should think of the problem right out of the gate: carefully and precisely. 
 Relevance to my areas of study should be returned to in-depth later.

# Methodology

## Definitions

Before proceeding, the terminology of this study should be established. As this work spans multiple domains, and makes reference to recently introduced concepts, it is important to establish a shared understanding of language within these pages.

Note that the treatment here is cursory; a more in-depth look can be found in Chapter 2. (TODO better reference)
