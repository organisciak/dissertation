## Definitions and History

### Crowdsourcing

Crowdsourcing refers to "groups of disparate people, connected through technology, contributing to a common product" [@organisciak_why_2010].
It is an umbrella term that broadly captures the abilities of the internet, as a communications medium, to efficient connect people.

Nothing about crowdsourcing is fundamentally tied to the internet.
It is entirely possible to bring together large groups of people in different ways, but the access and efficiency of the internet is both
what made the concept seem so novel in the 20th century and what gave it value in the various realms where it was applied.

Whereas crowds have been long maligned for their collective simplicity \cite{<!--TODO: CMST101-->},
irrationality \cite{<!--TODO: Lebon? or next citation? -->},
or downright ineptness \cite{<!--TODO Mackay-->},
through the internet one can perform human-specific tasks at a scale usually only seen for computational tasks.

To understand crowdsourcing, a brief understanding of its history is necessary.
The term is recent and has an unambiguous source, but immediately upon introduction, it was adopted and expanded by society.

The term _crowdsourcing_ was coined in a 2006 Wired article by Jeff Howe \cite{<!--TODO cite Howe 2006 1-->}.
Howe was writing from a labor perspective, looking at online marketplaces for people to solve problems and create content.
His focus was on sites like InnoCentive, a site for companies to outsource research and development problems for a bounty, and iStockPhoto, a website that allowed amateur photographers to sell their images as stock photos.
The article briefly looked at user-generated online content, though in the context of television programs that use online video as content.

However, the term _crowdsourcing_ struck a chord more broadly, and the somewhat narrow term was culturally co-opted.
This happened very quickly: within nine days Howe noted a jump from three Google results to 189,000 \cite{<!--TODO: birth of a meme-->}.
Within a month, Howe address the co-opting of the term on his crowdsourcing blog, "noticing that the word is being used somewhat interchangably with Yochai Benkler's concept of commons-based peer production" \cite{<!--TODO-->}.
He gives his own definition, but also notes that language is slippery and he's "content to allow the crowd define the term for itself (in no small part because [he's] powerless to stop it.)".

Thus, crowdsourcing was adopted to refer broadly to a series of related concepts, all related to people being connected online.
These concepts included
 human computation \cite{<!--TODO-->},
 commons-based peer production \cite{<!--TODO cite coase's penguin and benkler book -->},
 free and open-source development [@lakhani_how_2003, @raymond_cathedral_1999],
 and the 'wisdom of the crowds' [@surowiecki_wisdom_2004].

### Human-Computation

_Human Computation_ emerged from from the doctoral dissertation work by Luis von Ahn in 2005, popularized alongside the ESP Game [@ahn_labeling_2004; @von_ahn_games_2006]. <!--_-->
It refers to a process of computation -- the "mapping of some input representation to some output representation using an explicit, finite set of instruction" [@law_defining_2011] -- performed by humans.

In synthesizing the definition of human computation in relation to crowdsourcing, collection intelligence, and social computing, Quinn and Bederson note two characteristics of consensus:
 that "the problems fit the general paradigm of computation, and as such might someday be solvable by computers", and 
 that "the human participation is direction by the computational system or process" [@quinn_human_2011].

As noted by @[TODO cite law], Turing defined the purpose of computers as carrying out operations that humans would normally do.
Human Computation, then, refers to utilizing humans for operations that computers simply are not capable of performed yet.

By this definition, much human computation aligns with crowdsourcing, but large swaths of crowdsourcing are not relevant to human computation.
For example, the types of large creative crowdsourcing projects like t-shirt design website Threadless and online encyclopedia Wikipedia are not human computation.
Inversely, human computation does not have to sustained by self-selected workers; a more traditionally hired closed system can suffice [@law_defining_2011].

## Taxonomies of Crowdsourcing

The space of crowdsourcing is large, and there have been a number of attempts to organize the sub-concepts within it or to reconcile it in a space alongside other areas of research.
Below, I'll look at some of the most important lenses applied.
