# Appendix: Co-authorship Notes

A number of studies within this dissertation are the product of collaborations.

In _Design Facets of Crowdsourcing_, work was completed with Michael B. Twidale.
Twidale provided advising and editing, and his ideas co-mingle throughout the paper or have prodded my own contributions in unquantifiable ways.

This study was completed for this dissertation, originally drafted for the preceding proposal, and was updated for @organisciak_design_2015. The version presented here iterates on that presentation. Copyright to the text presented is retained by the authors.

In _Interpreting Objective Tasks for Paid Crowdsourcing_, work was completed alongside Miles Efron, Katrina Fenlon, and Megan Senseney.
Work was advised by Efron, and the study was an outgrowth of @efron_building_2011.
All authors contributed editing support.
Efron and Fenlon contributed oracle judgments, making up part of the evaluation dataset.
Fenlon contributed the initial text describing the IMLS DCC.

This work was initially presented at the annual meeting of the Association of Information Science and Technology [ASIS&T 2012 - @organisciak_evaluating_2012]. Copyright to the text is retained by the authors.

In _Designing Task for Objective Needs_, work on part 2 was completed alongside Stephen Downie.
Stephen contributed advising on the work and gave permission to use the data.

This work was completed for this dissertation but published beforehand as a standalone study [@organisciak_improving_2015], presented at the ACM/IEEE Join Conference on Digital Libraries (JCDL 2015). Permission for dissertation re-use is  provided by the ACM alongside reference to the original work.

In _Designing Tasks for Subjective Needs_, work was completed with Jaime Teevan, Susan Dumais, Adam Tauman Kalai, and Robert C. Miller.

The co-authors advised greatly on this study.
Since this chapter is a new presentation of previously reported results, much of the writing is new. However, Teevan contributed significant editing and advising support, and parts of the introduction and related work section include text attributable to Teevan.
Additionally, data in the section _Handwriting Imitation; Style-Grokking_ was collated by co-author Kalai.
Earlier publication of this work [HCOMP - @organisciak_crowd_2014, and an award-track rewrite for IJCAI - @organisciak_matching_2015] has signification editing contributions from the coauthors.
