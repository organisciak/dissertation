 * Design Tasks
    1. Additional literature review?
    2. Find or collect Twtter dataset
    3. Annotate gold standard set?
    4. Build measurement instruments
        1. Basic Design
            * Prepare Infrastructure for collecting data (Backbone + Node.js + Express + Heroku)
        2. Indicators of Quality Design
        3. Training Design
            * Should measure when people get the task wrong

    5. Data Collection
        * First task: offer bonus for workers that return for more
            * Since both the Indicators of Quality Design and the Training Design require at least two task sets to be completed
        * Payment amount: determined based on time spent statistics
