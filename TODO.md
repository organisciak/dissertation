This Week
----------

* Write bullet points for Mike
* Send dissertation text to Miles and Mike
* Research biases further: what exactly am I talking about
* More thought experiments: spitball some crazy ideas, then research existing literation to determine tractability
* Keep collecting examples
	* This is importatnt earlier on,and often left for later


Next Week
----------

* Send updates to rest of team

In General
-----------

* Mike wants to take a couple of weeks scoping out the space of possible research to maximize my impact

EXAMPLES
=========

* O.E.D.
	* Disparity in effort between reading and checking.
	* When somebody submits a reference for a word in a work, you can easily verify it
* Bug fixes
	* Hard to find out of the blue, but easy to fix once found

* Stack Overflow as an example of where there is a strong structure that isn't always understood by workers: some posts that do not fit within their rules grow really popular, especially early on.

IDEAS
======

* Crowdsourcing for alt-metrics: what's the relationship? When a company tracks Twitter for sentiment, for example

* Implicit vs. Explicit crowdsourcing
	* Am I focusing on explicit?
	* Where does incidental crowdsourcing fit in my dissertation? What about the big data approach, of collecting incidental information on people?
